# Pizza-sales-Analysis-Dashboard
Thrilled to Share My Latest Data Analysis Project! 🎉🍕
I'm excited to showcase my recent project where I used Power BI to analyze a pizza dataset. This project allowed me to explore customer preferences, sales trends, and identify key performance indicators within the pizza industry.
Key Skills Demonstrated:
Data Modeling: Successfully imported the pizza dataset into Power BI for insightful analysis. 📊
Data Cleaning: Utilized Power BI Query Editor to meticulously clean and transform the data. This included eliminating duplicate entries and effectively handling missing values. 🧹
Data Visualization: Created interactive reports leveraging Power BI's visualization tools:
Slicers: Implemented two slicers, one for pizza category and another for pizza size, enabling users to filter data and conduct focused analysis. 🍕🍕
Cards: Provided key metrics at a glance, such as total revenue, average pizzas sold per day, total pizza sales, total number of orders, and average order value. 💰
Charts: Employed a variety of charts to illustrate insightful trends:
Column Chart: Visualized the total number of orders by weekday. 📅
Donut Chart: Showcased the distribution of total revenue across different pizza categories. 🍩
Pie Chart: Represented the total number of orders for each pizza size. 🍕
Multi-Row Cards: Highlighted the top 5 best-selling pizzas and bottom 5 least-selling pizzas. 🏆📉
Treemap: Provided a hierarchical view of total sales quantity by weekday. 📅
